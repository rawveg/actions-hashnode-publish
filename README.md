A GitHub Action and CLI tool to publish markdown articles to Hashnode from a GitHub repository using GraphQL API.

## Features

- Validate markdown files
- Create drafts or publish articles directly to Hashnode
- Support for tags and frontmatter
- GitHub Action integration
- CLI tool for local usage
- Prevents duplicate submissions with status tracking
- Recursive directory processing for batch publishing

## Markdown Format

Your markdown files should include frontmatter with the following format:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Article Title"
subtitle: "Your Article Subtitle"  # Optional: Article subtitle
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
coverImage: "https://example.com/cover.jpg"  # Optional: Cover image URL
canonicalUrl: "https://example.com/original-article"  # Optional: Original source URL
articleId: "123"      # Optional: ID of an existing article
draftId: "456"        # Optional: ID of an existing draft
---

Your article content here...
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `title` | Article title (max 100 chars) | Yes |
| `subtitle` | Article subtitle (can also be specified in title as "Title: Subtitle") | No |
| `tags` | Array of tags (max 5, each max 20 chars) | Yes |
| `coverImage` | URL to the cover image for the article | No |
| `canonicalUrl` | Original source URL for cross-posted content | No |
| `articleId` | ID of an existing article (for updates) | No |
| `draftId` | ID of an existing draft (for updates) | No |

**Field Usage:**

- **`subtitle`**: Optional subtitle for your article. You can specify it in two ways:
  - Explicitly in the frontmatter: `subtitle: "My Subtitle"`
  - Embedded in the title using a colon separator: `title: "My Title: My Subtitle"`
  - If both are present, the explicit `subtitle` field takes precedence
- **`coverImage`**: URL to an image that will be used as the cover/hero image for your article. Must be a publicly accessible URL.
- **`canonicalUrl`**: Specify the original source URL when cross-posting content from another site. This helps with SEO and gives proper attribution.
- **`articleId`**: ID of an existing published article. Automatically populated after publishing.
- **`draftId`**: ID of an existing draft. Automatically populated after creating a draft.
- These ID fields are used to track and update existing content

## CLI Usage

The tool can be used as a CLI tool by running `node dist/index.js` with the following commands:

```bash
# Validate a single markdown file
node dist/index.js validate blog/hello-world.md

# Validate all markdown files in a folder (non-recursive)
node dist/index.js validate blog/

# Validate all markdown files in a folder recursively
node dist/index.js validate blog/ --recursive

# Validate and continue even if there are errors
node dist/index.js validate blog/ --continue-on-error

# Validate recursively and continue on error
node dist/index.js validate blog/ --recursive --continue-on-error

# Create a draft
node dist/index.js draft blog/hello-world.md --token YOUR_TOKEN --publication-id YOUR_PUB_ID

# Publish an article
node dist/index.js publish blog/hello-world.md --token YOUR_TOKEN --publication-id YOUR_PUB_ID

# Dry run (validate without publishing)
node dist/index.js draft blog/hello-world.md --token YOUR_TOKEN --publication-id YOUR_PUB_ID --dry-run
```

You can also set your Hashnode token and publication ID as environment variables:

```bash
export TOKEN=your_hashnode_token
export PUBLICATION_ID=your_publication_id
```

Then you can run the commands without specifying them:

```bash
node dist/index.js validate blog/hello-world.md
node dist/index.js validate blog/
node dist/index.js validate blog/ --continue-on-error
node dist/index.js draft blog/hello-world.md
node dist/index.js publish blog/hello-world.md
```

## GitHub Action Usage

> **Note:** The `command` input is now required for all modes (including validation). Set it to `validate`, `draft`, or `publish` as needed.

```yaml

        with:
          command: validate  # Required: validate, draft, or publish
          file_path: blog/
          recursive: true  # Process all markdown files in subdirectories
          continue_on_error: true  # Continue even if some files have validation errors

  publish:
    needs: validate
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

        with:
          command: publish  # Required
          token: ${{ secrets.HASHNODE_TOKEN }}
          publication_id: ${{ secrets.HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_ID }}
          file_path: blog/hello-world.md  # Can be a single file or directory
          is_draft: false
          recursive: true  # Process all markdown files in subdirectories
```
